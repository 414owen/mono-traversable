This package provides common mutable containers, such as double-ended queues
and doubly-linked lists. It is implemented as both an abstract set of type
classes, and concrete implementations.

Note that this library should be considered extremely experimental. That said,
it currently has 100% test coverage and has some performance tuning, though the
API is expected to change significantly.
