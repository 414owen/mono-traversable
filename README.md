classy-prelude
==============

[This blog post does a good job of explaning the purpose of classy-prelude](http://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2013/09/classy-mono). It is worth noting that classy-prelude [is largely front-running changes that the community would like to make to the base Prelude](http://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2014/10/classy-base-prelude).

classy-prelude [should only be used by application developers](http://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2013/10/prelude-replacements-libraries). Library authors should consider using [mono-traversable](https://github.com/snoyberg/mono-traversable/blob/master/README.md), which classy-prelude builds upon.
